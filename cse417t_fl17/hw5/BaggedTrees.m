function [ oobErr ] = BaggedTrees( X, Y, numBags )
%BAGGEDTREES Returns out-of-bag classification error of an ensemble of
%numBags CART decision trees on the input dataset, and also plots the error
%as a function of the number of bags from 1 to numBags
%   Inputs:
%       X : Matrix of training data
%       Y : Vector of classes of the training examples
%       numBags : Number of trees to learn in the ensemble
