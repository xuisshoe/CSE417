%perceptron_learn Run PLA on the input data
%   Inputs: data_in: Assumed to be a matrix with each row representing an
%                    (x,y) pair, with the x vector augmented with an
%                    initial 1, and the label (y) in the last column
%   Outputs: w: A weight vector (should linearly separate the data if it is
%               linearly separable)
%            iterations: The number of iterations the algorithm ran for
