function [ num_iters bounds] = perceptron_experiment ( N, d, num_samples )
%perceptron_experiment Code for running the perceptron experiment in HW1
%   Inputs: N is the number of training examples
%           d is the dimensionality of each example (before adding the 1)
%           num_samples is the number of times to repeat the experiment
%   Outputs: num_iters is the # of iterations PLA takes for each sample
%            bounds is the theoretical bound on the # of iterations
%              for each sample
%      (both the outputs should be num_samples long)
